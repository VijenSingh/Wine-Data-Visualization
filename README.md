# SDE Interview - Data Visualization Task

This repository contains the solution for the Data Visualization task of the SDE interview. The task involves calculating statistical measures for the Wine Data Set and displaying the results in a tabular format using React.

## Task Description

1. Calculation of statistical measures:
   - Class-wise mean, median, and mode of "Flavanoids" for the entire dataset.
   - Class-wise mean, median, and mode of "Gamma" for the entire dataset.
2. Display the calculated values in a tabular format using React.
3. Clean code, modularity, folder structure, and quality of comments.
4. Bonus points for using TypeScript.

## Solution

The solution is implemented using TypeScript, React, and Yarn as per the requirements. The main files of the solution are:

- **src/App.js**: Contains the main React component that calculates the statistical measures and displays them in a tabular format.
- **src/components/utils.js**: Contains utility functions to calculate the mean, median, and mode of an array of numbers.
- **src/components/Wine-Data**: Contains the sample Wine Data Set used for calculation.

## Setup Instructions

To run the solution on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd sde-interview-data-visualization`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Start the application: `yarn start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.
